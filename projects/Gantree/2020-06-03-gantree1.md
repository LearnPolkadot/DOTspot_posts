**By: Alexander Ramsey, CEO of Gantree**

The Gantree team are developing products that will democratise participation in the peer to peer economy by making it easy for organisations to create and operate their own node infrastructure. Our mission is to empower any organisation to grow and cultivate a peer to peer economy and we see reliable and configurable node infrastructure as critical to the success of that mission and Web3 attaining permanence.

We believe that to ensure a robust and healthy edge computing ecosystem it must be easy to operate node infrastructure with business-grade reliability and mass-market simplicity. Operating business-grade node infrastructure is a craft and if you donâ€™t know this craft it requires hiring key personnel with specific knowledge or paying for an expensive turnkey solution which doesnâ€™t give you the control you need.

Gantreeâ€™s initial product is an all-in-one infrastructure toolkit for Substrate-based blockchains. With Gantree you can:

1. Easily spin up, configure and tear down Substrate-based blockchain nodes on your preferred cloud provider or any machine you have SSH access to by using our CLI and a single configuration file, or our point and click web application.
2. Instantly spin up a dashboard to view telemetry and monitor various statistics about your nodes.
3. Monitor key metrics about any application specific blockchain and configure real-time alerts for these metrics.

## If youâ€™re building with Substrate and Gantree sounds useful, weâ€™d love to hear from you. We want what we build to help teams save money and ship faster. You can reach myself and Tom at our Flex Dapps emails:
